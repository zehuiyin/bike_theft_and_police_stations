## Project Overview:
This repository contains the source code for the R-based data analysis of the project **How Close is Too Close? Exploring the Relationship Between Bike Theft and Police Facility Distance in Toronto**. This project was completed for the course [SOCC70H3: Models of the Social World](https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/socc70h3) at the University of Toronto Scarborough in Winter 2024.

## Research Questions:
This project addresses the following two research questions:
1. What causal influence does the presence of police facilities have on the frequency of bike thefts in Toronto?
2. Upon observing a deterrent effect, to what extent does the proximity of police facilities causally mitigate bike theft incidents in Toronto?
